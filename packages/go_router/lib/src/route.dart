/// For example these routes:

/// differs in that it creates separate Navigators for each of its nested
/// branches (i.e. parallel navigation trees), making it possible to build an
/// app with stateful nested navigation. This is convenient when for instance
/// implementing a UI with a [BottomNavigationBar], with a persistent navigation
/// state for each tab.
///
/// A StatefulShellRoute is created by providing a List of [StatefulShellBranch]
/// items, each representing a separate stateful branch in the route tree. The
/// branches can be provided either statically, by passing a list of branches in
/// the constructor, or dynamically by instead providing a [branchBuilder].
/// StatefulShellBranch defines the root location(s) of the branch, as well as
/// the Navigator key ([GlobalKey]) for the Navigator associated with the
/// branch.
///
/// Like [ShellRoute], you can provide a [builder] and [pageBuilder] when
/// creating a StatefulShellRoute. However, StatefulShellRoute differs in that
/// the builder is mandatory and the pageBuilder will be used in addition to the
/// builder. The child parameters of the builders are also a bit different, even
/// though this should normally not affect how you implemented the builders.
///
/// For the pageBuilder, the child parameter will simply be the stateful shell
/// already built for this route, using the builder function. In the builder
/// function however, the child parameter is a Widget that contains - and is
/// responsible for managing - the Navigators for the different route branches
/// of this StatefulShellRoute. This widget is meant to be used as the body of a
/// custom shell implementation, for example as the body of [Scaffold] with a
/// [BottomNavigationBar].
///
/// The builder function of a StatefulShellRoute will be invoked from within a
/// wrapper Widget that provides access to the current [StatefulShellRouteState]
/// associated with the route (via the method [StatefulShellRoute.of]). That
/// state object exposes information such as the current branch index, the state
/// of the route branches etc. It is also with the help this state object you
/// can change the active branch, i.e. restore the navigation stack of another
/// branch. This is accomplished using the method
/// [StatefulShellRouteState.goBranch], and providing either a Navigator key,
/// branch name or branch index. For example:
///
/// ```
/// void _onBottomNavigationBarItemTapped(BuildContext context, int index) {
///   final StatefulShellRouteState shellState = StatefulShellRoute.of(context);
///   shellState.goBranch(index: index);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Sometimes you need greater control over the layout and animations of the
/// Widgets representing the branch Navigators. In such cases, the child
/// argument in the builder function can be ignored, and a custom implementation
/// can instead be built using the child widgets of the branches
/// (see [StatefulShellRouteState.children]) directly. For example:
///
/// ```
/// final StatefulShellRouteState shellState = StatefulShellRoute.of(context);
/// final int currentIndex = shellState.currentIndex;
/// final List<Widget?> children = shellRouteState.children;
/// return MyCustomShell(currentIndex, children);
/// ```
///
/// Below is a simple example of how a router configuration with
/// StatefulShellRoute could be achieved. In this example, a
/// BottomNavigationBar with two tabs is used, and each of the tabs gets its
/// own Navigator. A container widget responsible for managing the Navigators
/// for all route branches will then be passed as the child argument
/// of the builder function.
///
/// ```
